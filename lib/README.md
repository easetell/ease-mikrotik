Requesting a certificate for easebill.cloud

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: nginx). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: easebill.cloud
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 84.32.84.32: Invalid response from http://easebill.cloud/.well-known/acme-challenge/MZDp6lxkrJ5hGlq_Xkcxth9n_d2MONyS0Fyw3G2R8mE: "<!doctype html><title>Parked Domain name on Hostinger DNS system</title><meta charset=utf-8><meta content=\"IE=edge,chrome=1\" htt"

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary nginx configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure the listed domains point to this nginx server and that it is accessible from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
The error you're encountering indicates that Certbot was unable to verify your domain (easebill.cloud) because it is currently parked on Hostinger's DNS system. This means the domain is not pointing to your VPS's IP address (46.202.168.183), and Certbot cannot access the required challenge files to verify domain ownership.

To resolve this issue, you need to update your DNS settings so that easebill.cloud points to your VPS. Here's how to fix it:

Step 1: Update DNS Records
Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., Hostinger).

Navigate to the DNS management section for easebill.cloud.

Add or update the following DNS records:

A Record:

Name: @ (or leave blank, depending on your registrar)

Value: 46.202.168.183 (your VPS's IP address)

TTL: 3600 (or default)

CNAME Record (optional, for www):

Name: www

Value: easebill.cloud

TTL: 3600 (or default)

Save the changes.

Step 2: Verify DNS Propagation
DNS changes can take some time to propagate (usually a few minutes to a few hours). You can check if the DNS records have updated using the following tools:

DNS Checker: https://dnschecker.org

What's My DNS: https://www.whatsmydns.net

Enter your domain (easebill.cloud) and verify that it resolves to your VPS's IP address (46.202.168.183).

Step 3: Remove the Parked Domain Page
If your domain is still showing the Hostinger parked domain page, you may need to:

Log in to your Hostinger account.

Navigate to the Domains section.

Remove the parked domain page or disable it.

Step 4: Retry Certbot
Once the DNS records have propagated and the domain is pointing to your VPS, retry Certbot to obtain the SSL certificate:

Run Certbot again:

bash
Copy
sudo certbot --nginx -d easebill.cloud
Follow the prompts to complete the SSL certificate setup.

Step 5: Verify SSL Installation
Visit your domain in a browser:

Copy
https://easebill.cloud
Check that the SSL certificate is valid and the site loads correctly.

Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:

Check Nginx Configuration:

Ensure Nginx is running and configured correctly:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo nginx -t
Check Firewall Settings:

Ensure ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are open:

bash
Copy
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
Check Certbot Logs:

Review the Certbot logs for more details:

bash
Copy
sudo cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Alternative: Use a Different Domain
If you cannot resolve the DNS issue, you can use your server's IP address (46.202.168.183) temporarily or register a new domain and point it to your VPS.

now how do i add my .env.local
To add your .env.local file to your Next.js application on your Debian 12 VPS, follow these steps:

What is .env.local?
The .env.local file is used to store environment variables that are specific to your local development or production environment. These variables are typically sensitive (e.g., API keys, database credentials) and should not be committed to version control (e.g., Git).

Step 1: Create the .env.local File
Navigate to your Next.js project directory:

bash
Copy
cd ~/ease-mikrotik
Create the .env.local file:

bash
Copy
nano .env.local
Add your environment variables to the file. For example:

env
Copy
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname"
API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://easebill.cloud"
Note: Prefix public environment variables (those accessible in the browser) with NEXT_PUBLIC_.

Save and exit the file:

In nano, press CTRL + O, then Enter to save.

Press CTRL + X to exit.

Step 2: Ensure .env.local is Ignored by Git
If you're using Git, ensure that .env.local is listed in your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your repository.

Open the .gitignore file:

bash
Copy
nano .gitignore
Add the following line if it’s not already there:

bash
Copy
.env.local
Save and exit the file.

Step 3: Restart Your Next.js Application
For the changes in .env.local to take effect, you need to restart your Next.js application.

If you're using PM2, restart the process:

bash
Copy
pm2 restart ease-mikrotik
If you're running the app manually, stop and restart it:

bash
Copy
npm run build
npm start
Step 4: Verify Environment Variables
Check that your environment variables are being loaded correctly. You can log them in your Next.js app (e.g., in pages/index.js):

javascript
Copy
console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
console.log(process.env.API_KEY);
Restart the app and check the logs to ensure the variables are being used.

Step 5: (Optional) Use Environment Variables in Nginx
If you need to pass environment variables to your app via Nginx, you can do so in the Nginx configuration file.

Open your Nginx configuration file:

bash
Copy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/ease-mikrotik
Add environment variables to the location block:

nginx
Copy
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header DATABASE_URL "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname";
    proxy_set_header API_KEY "your-api-key-here";
}
Test the Nginx configuration:

bash
Copy
sudo nginx -t
Restart Nginx:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Step 6: Secure Your .env.local File
Ensure that your .env.local file is secure and not accessible to unauthorized users.

Set the correct file permissions:

bash
Copy
chmod 600 .env.local
Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or error messages.

Conclusion
Your .env.local file is now set up and ready to use in your Next.js application. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 🚀
